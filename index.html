                    <h3>Who is King Sejong?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>King Sejong was the fourth king of Joseon Dynasty, born on April 10, 1397, and died on February 17, 1450.</li>
                        <li>He is still the most beloved king among Koreans today because he loved the people and ruled the country with all his heart until his death.</li>
                        <li>He wrote and distributed books on farming to the people, but there were many people who could not read, so he made an easy-to-learn language.</li>
                        <li>He built a hall called Jiphyeonjeon inside the palace so that young scholars could concentrate on academic research. Through Jiphyeonjeon, many talented people were trained.</li>
                        <li>Excellent human resources have greatly improved the development of science and technology by creating many scientific inventions such as sundials, water clocks, and rain gauges.</li>
                    </ul>
